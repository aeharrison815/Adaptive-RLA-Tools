    TO DO: CHANGE FUNCTIONALITY, currently disabled
    Alternatively, the margin lines can be written as so: Margin=MOV, minimum number of ballots you wish to audit, maximum number of ballots you
    wish to audit. Ex:
    Margin=5, 20, 100
    means there is a 5% margin of victory, you want the simulation to look at a minimum of 20 ballots and a maximum of 100 ballots. If you wish
    to do a set sample size, the minimum and maximum ballots must be the same number (ex. Margin=5, 100, 100)
